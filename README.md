Important: To use the MATLAB script to plot data on the Transduction Atlas, please first download the file "mapdata_0_15.mat" from the following link due to the large file size: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/a2zf72zjhprkhrr7eu88r/mapdata_0_15.mat?rlkey=fzsf5dlchsrfd9du2dxny2xwe&st=xva7cste&dl=0. The DropBox link will show up as an unsupported file type, but click the downward pointing arrow and click "Download". Then place the file in the same folder as the other MATLAB files. 

Quick Reference Guides for tools can be found in Supplemental Figures S1 and S2.
Use MATLAB script "output_distribution.m" for integration distribution calculator.
Use GraphPad template "SMARTT_scVCN_Graphing_Template.prism" to visualize integration distributions.
Use GraphPad template "Transduction_Atlas_Template.prism" to plot transduction data on Transduction Atlas.
